### Vehicle_Detection
Vehicle Detection by Haar-Cascade with OpenCV

### Desctiption
The code uses the OpenCV library to create a Cascade classifier from a trained Haar-Cascade file and detect vehicles from frames of a video. 

The Haar-Cascade cars.xml was trained using 530 images in jpeg format. Resolution is constant at 320x240 pixels.
